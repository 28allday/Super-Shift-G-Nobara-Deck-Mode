**Version 13.00-fedora-kde**

Turn any Nobara (Fedora) KDE Plasma desktop into a Steam Deck-like gaming console with a single keybind. Press `Super+Alt+G` to enter Gaming Mode (Steam Big Picture in Gamescope), and use Steam's "Exit to Desktop" to return to KDE Plasma.

Built for [Nobara Linux](https://nobaraproject.org/) — a Fedora-based distribution running KDE Plasma and plasmalogin.

## What It Does

This installer transforms your desktop into a dual-mode system:

- **Desktop Mode** - Your normal KDE Plasma session
- **Gaming Mode** - Full-screen Steam Big Picture running inside Gamescope (the same compositor used by the Steam Deck), with automatic performance tuning, controller support, and external drive mounting

Switching between modes is seamless — plasmalogin handles session transitions, and all your network, audio, and peripherals carry over automatically.

## Requirements

- **OS**: [Nobara Linux](https://nobaraproject.org/) (Fedora-based)
- **Desktop**: KDE Plasma (Wayland)
- **Display Manager**: plasmalogin
- **GPU**: AMD (discrete or APU) or NVIDIA (discrete)
  - Intel-only systems are **not supported**
  - Intel iGPU + AMD/NVIDIA dGPU configurations work fine

> **Note**: This script is designed specifically for Nobara and its stack (KDE Plasma, plasmalogin, PipeWire). It uses `dnf` for package management and builds Gamescope from source as it is not available in Fedora repos. It is not intended for Arch-based distributions — see [Super-Shift-S-Omarchy-Deck-Mode](https://github.com/28allday/Super-Shift-S-Omarchy-Deck-Mode) for Omarchy/Arch.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/28allday/Super-Shift-G-Nobara-Deck-Mode.git
cd Super-Shift-G-Nobara-Deck-Mode
chmod +x super_shift_g_nobara.sh
./super_shift_g_nobara.sh
```

The installer is fully interactive and will walk you through each step.

## Usage

| Action | Keybind |
|--------|---------|
| Enter Gaming Mode | `Super + Alt + G` |
| Return to Desktop | Steam > Power > Exit to Desktop |

### Command-Line Options

```
./super_shift_g_nobara.sh              # Full installation
./super_shift_g_nobara.sh --verify     # Verify installation only
./super_shift_g_nobara.sh --version    # Show version
./super_shift_g_nobara.sh --help       # Show help
```

## How It Works

### Session Switching Flow

```
Desktop Mode (KDE Plasma)
    |
    +- Super+Alt+G pressed
    |   +- switch-to-gaming runs:
    |       +- Masks suspend targets (prevents sleep during switch)
    |       +- Updates plasmalogin config to gaming session
    |       +- Restarts plasmalogin -> boots into Gaming Mode
    |
Gaming Mode (Gamescope + Steam Big Picture)
    |
    +- On session start (gamescope-session-nm-wrapper):
    |   +- Enables performance mode (CPU governor, GPU tuning)
    |   +- Starts NetworkManager (for Steam network access)
    |   +- Launches steam-library-mount (external drive detection)
    |   +- Starts gaming-keybind-monitor
    |   +- Launches gamescope-session-plus with Steam
    |
    +- Steam > Power > Exit to Desktop
    |   +- switch-to-desktop runs:
    |       +- Unmasks suspend targets
    |       +- Restores Bluetooth
    |       +- Shuts down Steam gracefully
    |       +- Kills gamescope
    |       +- Updates plasmalogin config to KDE Plasma session
    |       +- Restarts plasmalogin -> boots into Desktop Mode
    |
    +- On session cleanup (trap handler):
        +- Kills steam-library-mount and keybind-monitor
        +- Stops NetworkManager, restores networking
        +- Restores balanced power mode
```

### Performance Mode

When Gaming Mode starts, the session wrapper automatically:

- Sets CPU governor to `performance` on all cores
- **NVIDIA**: Enables persistence mode, sets power limit to maximum, disables runtime suspend
- **AMD**: Sets GPU to high performance via `power_dpm_force_performance_level`
- Applies kernel sysctl tuning (scheduler, VM, inotify, network buffers)
- Sets power profile to `performance` (if power-profiles-daemon is available)

On exit, everything is restored to balanced/powersave defaults.

### GPU Detection

The installer automatically detects your GPU configuration:

- **AMD dGPU**: Detected via PCI device names (Navi, RDNA, Vega discrete cards)
- **AMD APU**: Detected via integrated GPU codenames (Phoenix, Rembrandt, Van Gogh, etc.)
- **NVIDIA**: Detected via lspci, configures `nvidia-drm.modeset=1` if missing
- **Multi-GPU**: Correctly identifies discrete vs integrated, selects dGPU for gaming

### Monitor Detection

The installer scans DRM connectors on your gaming GPU to find connected displays. If multiple monitors are connected to the dGPU, you can choose which one to use for Gaming Mode. Resolution and refresh rate are auto-detected from EDID data.

### External Drive Auto-Mount

The `steam-library-mount` daemon runs during Gaming Mode and:

1. Scans all connected drives for Steam library folders
2. Mounts drives containing `steamapps/` directories via udisks2
3. Monitors udev for hot-plugged drives
4. Unmounts non-Steam drives to avoid clutter

Supports ext4, NTFS, btrfs, xfs, exfat, f2fs, and vfat filesystems.

## Configuration

### Config File

The installer reads from `/etc/gaming-mode.conf` (or `~/.gaming-mode.conf` if it exists):

```bash
PERFORMANCE_MODE=enabled   # Set to "disabled" to skip performance tuning
```

### Gamescope Session Config

After installation, you can edit `~/.config/environment.d/gamescope-session-plus.conf`:

```bash
SCREEN_WIDTH=2560
SCREEN_HEIGHT=1440
CUSTOM_REFRESH_RATES=165
OUTPUT_CONNECTOR=DP-1
ADAPTIVE_SYNC=1            # AMD only
ENABLE_GAMESCOPE_HDR=1     # AMD only
```

**NVIDIA note**: Resolution is capped at 2560x1440 due to Gamescope limitations with NVIDIA GPUs.

### Shader Cache

The installer configures a 12GB shader cache by default in `/etc/environment.d/99-shader-cache.conf`. This reduces stutter in games by caching compiled shaders. Values can be adjusted:

```bash
MESA_SHADER_CACHE_MAX_SIZE=12G
__GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_SIZE=12884901888
DXVK_STATE_CACHE=1
```

## Key Differences from Omarchy Version

| | Omarchy (Arch) | Nobara (Fedora) |
|---|---|---|
| **Package manager** | pacman / yay | dnf |
| **Desktop** | Hyprland | KDE Plasma |
| **Display manager** | SDDM | plasmalogin |
| **Networking** | iwd | NetworkManager |
| **Gamescope** | pacman package | Built from source |
| **ChimeraOS session** | AUR packages | Cloned from GitHub |
| **Gaming keybind** | `Super+Shift+S` | `Super+Alt+G` |
| **Return keybind** | `Super+Shift+R` | Steam > Exit to Desktop |

## NVIDIA-Specific Notes

- **Kernel parameter**: `nvidia-drm.modeset=1` is required. The installer can configure this for GRUB.
- **Resolution cap**: Gamescope on NVIDIA is limited to 2560x1440 maximum.
- **Force composition**: The NVIDIA wrapper automatically adds `--force-composition` if supported by your Gamescope version.
- **Environment**: `GBM_BACKEND=nvidia-drm` and related vars are set automatically.
- **Persistence mode**: Enabled during gaming to keep the GPU initialised, disabled on exit.

## Troubleshooting

### Verify Installation

Run the built-in verification to check all files, permissions, packages, and services:

```bash
./super_shift_g_nobara.sh --verify
```

### Common Issues

**Gaming Mode doesn't start / black screen**
- Check NVIDIA kernel params: `cat /proc/cmdline | grep nvidia`
- Verify gamescope works: `gamescope -- steam`
- Check session logs: `journalctl --user -u gamescope-session -n 50`

**No network in Gaming Mode**
- Test NM manually: `sudo systemctl start NetworkManager && nmcli general`
- Check polkit rules: `ls -la /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-gamescope-*`

**Super+Alt+G doesn't work**
- Log out and back in after installation
- Check KDE System Settings > Shortcuts for "Switch to Gaming Mode"
- Verify the desktop file exists: `ls /usr/share/applications/switch-to-gaming.desktop`

**External drives not mounting**
- Ensure `udisks2` is installed: `rpm -q udisks2`
- Check polkit rules exist: `ls /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-udisks-gaming.rules`
- Check mount logs: `journalctl -t steam-library-mount -n 20`

**Audio stuttering in Gaming Mode**
- Check PipeWire config exists: `cat /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/10-gaming-latency.conf`
- Try lower quantum: edit the config and set `default.clock.min-quantum = 128`

**"NO DICE - INTEL ONLY DETECTED"**
- This system has only Intel graphics. Gaming Mode requires AMD or NVIDIA.
- If you have a discrete GPU, check that its driver is loaded: `lspci -k | grep -A2 VGA`

### Log Locations

| Component | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Gaming session | `journalctl --user -u gamescope-session` |
| NetworkManager | `journalctl -t gamescope-nm` |
| Drive mounting | `journalctl -t steam-library-mount` |
| Keybind monitor | `journalctl -t gaming-keybind-monitor` |
| Session wrapper | `journalctl -t gamescope-wrapper` |
| Installation | `journalctl -t gaming-mode` |
